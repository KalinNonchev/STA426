Now, let's proceed with the exercise!

Let's generate 100 random values from log-normal distribution wuth mu=1
and sigma=0.25:

```{r}
samples <- rlnorm(100, meanlog=1, sdlog=0.25)
```

Well done! Now we can create a histogram from this data:

```{r, echo=F}
# plot
hist(samples)
```

and from the log-transformed data:

```{r, echo=F}
# plot
hist(log(samples))
```

Let's find out the mean and the variance.

```{r}
mean(samples) # mean
```

```{r}
var(samples) # variance
```

... and from the log-transformed samples:

```{r}
mean(log(samples)) # mean
```

```{r}
var(log(samples)) # variance
```


#### So finally, the mean and the variance from the samples is 2.76213 and 0.5091734. When we log-transform the samples, we get a mean and variance of 0.983962 and 0.0646809
